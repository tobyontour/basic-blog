A basic blog site in Django

Ultimately I'd like the fabric scripts to deploy to Dreamhost and Digital 
Ocean and Amazon and Google and anywhere else I can deploy to. For now it
deploys cleanly to Dreamhost shared hosting.

## Licence

The theme that is in the /theme directory is licenced under the conditions
in the LICENCE file in that directory. I have not modified that code.
