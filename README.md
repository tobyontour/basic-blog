A basic blog site in Django

## Motavation

Learning any new framework is tough (if it's any good) and getting a simple 
but complete site up and running with all tests passing and full coverage is 
rarely simple.

Add to that the lack of context with examples and it can be a bit frustrating.

So here is a simple Django blog site - a bit like a stripped-down Wordpress - 
that I've built using test-driven development that hopefully demonstrates a 
lot of the basic techniques.

Ultimately I'd like the fabric scripts to deploy to Dreamhost and Digital 
Ocean and Amazon and Google and anywhere else I can deploy to. For now it
deploys cleanly to Dreamhost shared hosting.

## Licence

The theme that is in the /theme directory is licenced under the conditions
in the LICENCE file in that directory. I have not modified that code.
